          Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer money quickly around the world.
          It works 24/7 every day of the week. There is no limit or closing time
          as with the bank.

          <h1>Very Low Transaction Fees</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          It only costs a few cents to transfer money with Bitcoin. Compared to
          banks that charge a fixed fee and in many cases 1.5-3.0% per
          transaction.

        <p>
          Bitcoin works without the need to trust anyone. All payments are made
          person-to-person without any intermediary or bank. You decide for
          yourself.

          <h1>Protect Your Money Against Inflation</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          An inflation rate of 2% means that you lose half of your money after
          35 years. Bitcoin, however, has a limited supply that no central bank
          can manipulate.
